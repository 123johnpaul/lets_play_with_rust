    <h1>HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU MOM!!!</h1>
    <p>This is actually like the first time i am staying away from home for either you or Dad's birthdays
        <br>I won't lie it actually feels weird hopefully it'll all be worth it in the end
    <br>Omorr mummy what to write is plenty sha i don't know where to start from. I cant say it has been easy for anyone in our family,
but you have been a source of hope and light to not just your kids but your husband to. Even with the flaws you are the best mom one could ask for in the world.
I dont think any mother can go through what you have survived, you are just wonderful.
An epitome of beauty and grace, Mom no matter how tough things seem your soothing words always seem to make every one have hope.
Your faith in God is very wonderful, you trained your kids in the best way possible.
I pray that the good God grants you health,long life,blessings. You and your husband will live to enjoy the fruit of your labour.
lemme stop here I'll drop some of our pictures down</p>
